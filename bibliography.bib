  abstract = {Backscatter is the underwater photographer's arch nemesis. We've all taken shots riddled with the distracting white specs, whether they dot the whole picture or form two semi-circles on the edge of the frame. Backscatter can (and often does) destroy an otherwise-excellent image. The good news is that there are some universal techniques for eliminating backscatter that can be applied to a variety of composition styles, from macro to wide-angle. What is Backscatter?},

  abstract = {When filming underwater, small spots of debris reflect the light from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) reducing the camera image quality, this is known as backscatter. The purpose of this project is to create a machine vision-based lighting system using a smart projector, to eliminate backscatter from a video feed. In this project, the foundational testing of this anti-backscatter lighting system has been conducted. Previously with the use of image processing on captured images, backscatter has been removed using variations of median filtering. However, this can leave areas of the image blurry where the backscatter has been removed and does not eliminate the backscatter when capturing the video live. In this project with the use of a Raspberry Pi, a high- quality camera and a smart projector, the bright areas of backscatter can be successfully removed in live video feeds. The camera feeds back the position of detected bright spots in the scene, and then black holes are projected in these positions to not illuminate the backscatter, hence eliminating it. The results from testing have found issues with parallax and camera depth perception which make projecting holes accurately very complex, and this needs to be addressed further in future work. The project demonstrates, that with the use of a machine vision-based lighting system, backscatter of a variety of shapes and sizes can be detected and then eliminated from the scene. This project is just the beginning of a larger goal to eliminate backscatter in an underwater environment, and with all the foundational testing conducted successfully in the air, the system is ready to be thoroughly experimented with underwater.},

  abstract = {Unmanned underwater vehicles UUV are any vehicles that are able to operate underwater without a human occupant. Smaller and cheaper autonomous underwater vehicles AUV are today very capable and gaining users. Large autonomous underwater vehicles are more expensive but they offer capabilities in some missions and applications that no other platforms can offer. However, using unmanned underwater vehicles in marine applications provide some challenges such as noisy communication, position uncertainty and the likelihood of robot failures. In addition, standards for data and information sharing are not well defined and, as mature as it is, the unmanned underwater vehicle field is still an emerging sector. Within the last decade, interest in UUV to be part of specific military, industrial and academic missions and applications have increased due to technological innovation and the evolution of their sensor payload. Missions such as persistent surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, oceanography and mine coutermeasure are amongst those where UUV capabilities far exceed those offered by other platforms. Canadas vast coastal areas could benefit from the introduction of UUVs to perform various roles. On one hand, their use is very cost-effective. On the other hand, they offer persistence and data quality that are not achievable using traditional methods. This usefulness is even more reflected in remote environments, where deploying personnel is a very costly alternatives. In order to enable the integration of the data and information provided by a UUV it is necessary to have a look in the underlying data and information sharing standards related to them. Achievement of interoperability between multiple national and international agencies is mandatory if one seeks to use the UUV to its full potential in support of the generation of more complete maritime domain awareness.},
