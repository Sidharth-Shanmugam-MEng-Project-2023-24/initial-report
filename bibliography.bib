DLP technology is used in DLP front projectors (standalone projection units for classrooms and business primarily), DLP rear projection television sets, and digital signs.

The optimal population size takes a wide range of values, but, with one exception, scales sub-linearly with the problem dimension. The global optimum can be located in all but one function. The performance for locating the global optimum scales between linear and cubic with the problem dimension. In a comparison to state-of-the-art global search strategies the CMA evolution strategy achieves superior performance on multimodal, non-separable test functions without intricate parameter tuning.},

New results are: (1) The formulation and methods of solution of the problem apply without modification to stationary and nonstationary statistics and to growing-memory and infinite-memory filters. (2) A nonlinear difference (or differential) equation is derived for the covariance matrix of the optimal estimation error. From the solution of this equation the co-efficients of the difference (or differential) equation of the optimal linear filter are obtained without further calculations. (3) The filtering problem is shown to be the dual of the noise-free regulator problem. The new method developed here is applied to two well-known problems, confirming and extending earlier results. The discussion is largely self-contained and proceeds from first principles; basic concepts of the theory of random processes are reviewed in the Appendix.},

  abstract = {When filming underwater, small spots of debris reflect the light from Unmanned Underwater Vehicles (UUVs) reducing the camera image quality, this is known as backscatter. The purpose of this project is to create a machine vision-based lighting system using a smart projector, to eliminate backscatter from a video feed. In this project, the foundational testing of this anti-backscatter lighting system has been conducted. Previously with the use of image processing on captured images, backscatter has been removed using variations of median filtering. However, this can leave areas of the image blurry where the backscatter has been removed and does not eliminate the backscatter when capturing the video live. In this project with the use of a Raspberry Pi, a high- quality camera and a smart projector, the bright areas of backscatter can be successfully removed in live video feeds. The camera feeds back the position of detected bright spots in the scene, and then black holes are projected in these positions to not illuminate the backscatter, hence eliminating it. The results from testing have found issues with parallax and camera depth perception which make projecting holes accurately very complex, and this needs to be addressed further in future work. The project demonstrates, that with the use of a machine vision-based lighting system, backscatter of a variety of shapes and sizes can be detected and then eliminated from the scene. This project is just the beginning of a larger goal to eliminate backscatter in an underwater environment, and with all the foundational testing conducted successfully in the air, the system is ready to be thoroughly experimented with underwater.},

However, due to technical limitations in the past photo images had to be processed manually or semi-automatically. Recent advances in technology have rapidly improved image recording, storage and processing capabilities which are used in a new concept of automated in situ gas quantification by photo-optical detection. The design for an in situ high-speed image acquisition and automated data processing system is reported ("Bubblemeter"). New strategies have been followed with regards to back-light illumination, bubble extraction, automated image processing and data management. This paper presents the design of the novel method, its validation procedures and calibration experiments. The system will be positioned and recovered from the sea floor using a remotely operated vehicle (ROV). It is able to measure bubble flux rates up to 10 L/min with a maximum error of 33\% for worst case conditions. The Bubblemeter has been successfully deployed at a water depth of 1023 m at the Makran accretionary prism offshore Pakistan during a research expedition with R/V Meteor in November 2007.},

  abstract = {FPGAs provide a flexible architecture for implementing many different types of machine vision algorithms. They allow heavily parallel portions of those algorithms to be accelerated and optimized for high specific performance (MIPS:Watt ratio). In comparison to ASICS, FPGAs enable low cost, quick turn prototyping and algorithm development as well as lower production costs for small quantity and one off applications. FPGAs also have the ability to be reprogrammed in flight, allowing them to be configured for different applications as mission needs evolve. JPL has developed a suite of machine vision IP cores to accelerate many common machine vision tasks used in robotic mobility applications. Modules such as stereo correlation for ranging, filtering, optical flow, area based correlation, feature detection, and image homography and rectification allow the real-time processing of image data using much smaller systems with much less power draw then an appropriately sized general purpose processor. These modules, along with a vision processing framework, are being re-cast in a generic plug and play form to allow rapid, low cost configuration, reconfiguration, evolution and adaptation of next generation machine vision systems for mobile robotics.},

  abstract = {Unmanned underwater vehicles UUV are any vehicles that are able to operate underwater without a human occupant. Smaller and cheaper autonomous underwater vehicles AUV are today very capable and gaining users. Large autonomous underwater vehicles are more expensive but they offer capabilities in some missions and applications that no other platforms can offer. However, using unmanned underwater vehicles in marine applications provide some challenges such as noisy communication, position uncertainty and the likelihood of robot failures. In addition, standards for data and information sharing are not well defined and, as mature as it is, the unmanned underwater vehicle field is still an emerging sector. Within the last decade, interest in UUV to be part of specific military, industrial and academic missions and applications have increased due to technological innovation and the evolution of their sensor payload. Missions such as persistent surveillance, anti-submarine warfare, oceanography and mine coutermeasure are amongst those where UUV capabilities far exceed those offered by other platforms. Canadas vast coastal areas could benefit from the introduction of UUVs to perform various roles. On one hand, their use is very cost-effective. On the other hand, they offer persistence and data quality that are not achievable using traditional methods. This usefulness is even more reflected in remote environments, where deploying personnel is a very costly alternatives. In order to enable the integration of the data and information provided by a UUV it is necessary to have a look in the underlying data and information sharing standards related to them. Achievement of interoperability between multiple national and international agencies is mandatory if one seeks to use the UUV to its full potential in support of the generation of more complete maritime domain awareness.},

  abstract = {Passive acoustic methods are suitable for long-term seabed gas leak monitoring with high accuracy under the condition of low cost and simple experimental equipment. However, the impact of noise in complex underwater environments poses great challenges for measurements. In this paper, aiming at the quantitative detection problem, a theoretical model of the bubble generation process by underwater gas escape is established, and the mechanism of bubble acoustic signal generation is clarified. The model identification of bubble volume oscillation is realized through the complementary ensemble empirical mode decomposition (CEEMD) method. Then continuous bubbles are segmented by the normalized energy method to achieve a high-precision measurement of volume inversion. A measurement prototype is developed and tested in the lake with multiple noises caused by seawater disturbance, sea wind, and ships. The results showed that the measurement errors could be kept within 10\% even under the condition of strong noise interference.},
