Figure \ref{fig:gantt_chart} portrays a Gantt chart outlining the approach from the section above. At the end of each week on Friday, in parallel with the weekly email updates, I will evaluate this schedule to update the chart with any progress changes. I intend to approach this schedule as a 'live' document with constant change by preserving a complete version history.
